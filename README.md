### 👋 Hi there, I'm Amit Sharma. A Fullstack developer :electron:  and a fitness enthusiast 🏃‍♂️
I've completed my bachelors degree in computer science 🎓 from Amity University 🏛️
and I currently work at iDreamCareer as a Fullstack Engineer building a top-notch career guidance product for students 🧑‍💻
I have a passion for development(maybe) because I really like what I do and I aspire to do BIG things in the near future(Trust me, I will). I also work with React Native in my free time.
apart from that I love working out :running: and reading/watching novels/movies about 
wizarding world :zap:
